        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>We are the Oliver family, owners of Fresh of the Press. With collective backgrounds in print, architecture, finance, and coffee, we chose to combine our strengths into a real-life passion project. </p>
        <p>In October of 2020, we launched Fresh off the Press on Chorro Street in Downtown San Luis Obispo. We have grown from a family-run business to a staff of 25, and we thank you all for making our dream a reality. Thank you so much to all of you who have made this possible.</p>
        <p>Our goal has always been to create a creative and safe space for people to exist in outside of their everyday lives. Design a mug, create a mug and drink some coffee with us.</p>
        <p>We hope you love it here!</p>
