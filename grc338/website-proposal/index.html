					<h1> About </h1>
                        <p> At With Love our team finds vintage and used furniture and turns them into pieces to accommodate modern lifestyles. As a group of sustainably-minded creatives, we work to keep furniture out of landfills and instead give them a second life. With Love was founded by Cal Poly alumnae Elianna Oliver in 2022. The store was originally a family passion project but has shifted to a community-based space to explore and find employment at the intersection of design and sustainability. We are more than excited to have you help us on our journey to more eco-friendly and fabulous spaces. As always, our furniture is made with love. </p>

                        <h3>Sofas & Sectionals </h3>
                            <p> With our larger seating options we bring color and patterns into traditional sofas, sectionals, loveseats, and lounge designs. We house a variety of pieces that serve different functions: entertaining a crowd, comforting a family, providing a routine cozy spot for two, or acting as a prop for staging/decor purposes. </p>

                        <h3>Tables & Desks </h3>
                            <p> In a society evolving into different definitions of a workplace environment and a large shift to at-home offices, we tailor our desk and table options to meet these needs. With Love sources designs to elevate the workspace and inspire productivity. Our tables are chosen for their versatility, dual-functionality, and harmonious design. </p>

                        <h3>Chairs </h3>
                            <p> A chair can mean different things to different people. Whether that is a comfortable place to rest, support for a long day of work, or a welcoming place to host a guest, we house a wide variety. With Love sources multiple style chairs to surround spaces like your dining room table, office desk, or living room corner. We bring fun colors and intricate fabrics into our designs to add a pop of fun to your living space.</p>

                        <h3>Dressers & Storage </h3>
                            <p> While storage is not always the most fun concept, it is vital for staying organized. We like to keep our dressers and storage units minimal with detailed and intricate hardware. Our sourcing scouts spend extra time locating vintage and used doorknobs and handles to add an aura of uniqueness to our pieces. With Love houses a variety of aesthetics in our designs to meet customer needs. From rustic painted dressers to clean metal drawers with eclectic handles, you are sure to find a storage piece to stand out or blend in with your interiors. </p>

                            <p> While our main focus is furniture, With Love recognizes consumers' desires to make spaces their own through various decor items. Our storefront houses fluctuating ornamentation pieces such as lamps, thrifted art pieces, centerpiece items, pots, among other wonderful nick-nacks. In addition to our beautiful and unique furniture, we encourage customers to pick complementary pieces to enhance their living environment. </p>
